# firstflutter

This project is very simple learning for DIO, FREEZED and RIVERPOD.
For new developers and people who have a little knowledge of flutter and state management will be really beneficial from this code.

This project show how to call an api using dio and parse it using json parser along with freezed package for models.

I have also added on first tab i.e index 0 the api call so when you will press fist tab  you will see data on screen from frist index of data list

More over this project also explains to manage stats i.e loading, initail, fetchdata success/ Error for handling in widget.
